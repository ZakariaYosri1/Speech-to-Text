# Audio Processing App

This application provides a simple interface for recording audio, analyzing its frequency spectrum, and converting speech to text using various languages.

## Features:

- **Record Audio:** Record audio from your microphone.
- **Frequency Spectrum Analysis:** Visualize the frequency spectrum of the recorded audio using Discrete Fourier Transform and Hilbert Transform.
- **Speech to Text Conversion:** Convert recorded speech to text in different languages using Google Speech Recognition API.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Sounddevice
- SpeechRecognition
- Wavio
- SciPy
